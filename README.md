# **Flappy Bird MOBILE**

A simple version of Flappy Bird made in Unity Engine that I followed with the help of **CodeMonkey** video tutorial.
On the way, I learned a lot about efficient scripting and so got deeper into 2D topics.

## **Game Description**

The goal is not to hit the pipes by **`clicking`** in the screen to jump. Also if you fall to the ground you lose.

## **Features**

- **`DONE`** Bird movement as so the physics associated with that.
- **`DONE`** Pipe Creation.
- **`DONE`** Pipe Movimentation.
- **`DONE`** Level Generation, difficulty
- **`DONE`** Implemented UI's.
- **`DONE`** Sounds.
- **`DONE`** Highscore save and load system.
- **`DONE`** Waiting to start state.
